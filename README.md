# ECON 777 Problem Sets
This project contains all code to complete both problem sets for ECON 777: Empirical IO, taught by Professor Evan Saltzman. This repository does not contain the provided data or data documentation. Many thanks to Hannah Pitzer, Michaela Philip, Emerson Hamer, and Michelle Tao for their help and collaboration on these assignments. 

## Code 
Code is broken down into three main parts: (1) data cleaning, (2) Problem Set 1, and (3) Problem Set 2. `analysis/_main.R` will run all code, including cleaning and all analysis for both problem sets, in the correct order.
